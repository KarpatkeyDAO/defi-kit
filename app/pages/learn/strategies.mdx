# Strategies

Strategies are advanced interactions with DeFi protocols supporting predefined treasury management workflows, potentially involving multiple actions on different protocols.

  While DeFi Kit _actions_ are designed for general purpose use, _strategies_
  might be more tailored to specific operational needs of Karpatkey.

DeFi Kit makes it easy to compile permissions for running designated strategies.
Thes permissions can be applied to a role, enabling role members to trigger the respective strategies on behalf of the treasury.

Each strategy is fully automated through scricts in [TODO](TODO).
Their execution can be triggered from the [Agile Execution App](TODO).
For every Defeyes strategy, DeFi Kit includes the corresponding strategy permission set.
