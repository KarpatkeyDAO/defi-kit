# Strategies

Strategies are advanced interactions with DeFi protocols supporting pre-defined treasury management workflows potentially involving multiple actions with different protocols.
An example strategy would be an emergency withdrawal strategy that unstakes and proportionally withdraws funds from a protocol in case of a black swan market event.

  While DeFi Kit actions are designed for general purpose use, strategies might

Strategy execution scripts are implemented in [TODO](TODO).
They can be triggered through the [Agile Execution](TODO) app.
For every Defeyes strategy, DeFi Kit includes a corresponding strategy permission set.
Applying a strategy permission set to a roles allows role members to trigger that strategy on behalf of the treasury.
